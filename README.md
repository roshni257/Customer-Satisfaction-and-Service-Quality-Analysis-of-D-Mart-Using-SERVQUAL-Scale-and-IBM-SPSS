# 📊 Customer Satisfaction and Service Quality Analysis of D-Mart Using SERVQUAL Scale and IBM SPSS

## 📁 Repository Overview

This project is a detailed analysis of **customer satisfaction and service quality** at **D-Mart (Vande-Matram Road, Gota, India)** using the **SERVQUAL model** and **IBM SPSS**. The study assesses the five dimensions of service quality — Tangibles, Reliability, Responsiveness, Assurance, and Empathy — through a structured survey and applies statistical tools for data-driven insights.

## 🧠 Project Objectives

* Measure service quality at D-Mart using the SERVQUAL scale.
* Analyze customer satisfaction across demographic and behavioral segments.
* Identify statistically significant factors affecting satisfaction using SPSS.
* Visualize the service delivery process using a **Service Blueprint**.
* Suggest actionable recommendations based on gap analysis findings.

### 3. 📊 Data Analysis in SPSS

Using **IBM SPSS**, the following statistical tools were applied:

* **Frequency Analysis** (demographics & behavior patterns)
* **Descriptive Statistics** (mean, SD, variance)
* **Chi-Square Test** (occupation vs. shopping frequency)
* **One-Way ANOVA** (satisfaction vs. income/age)
* **Independent Sample T-Test** (gender-wise perception differences)
* **Multiple Regression** (identifying drivers of satisfaction)

### 4. 🗺️ Service Blueprint

A custom-designed **Service Blueprint PNG** visually represents:

* Customer journey
* Frontstage and backstage interactions
* Support processes and physical evidence
  This blueprint helps detect inefficiencies and improve operations.
